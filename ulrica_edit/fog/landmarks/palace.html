                    <h1 class="neighborhood"> The Palace of Fine Arts </h1>
                    <p class="neighborhooddesc">Since SF’s big earthquake, when developers disposed of rocky chunks of downtown and changed the Marina’s landscape from marshland to something inhabitable, this ’hood has acquired a reputation as a yuppie’s paradise. Despite the haters, the Marina offers more than just yoga pants, boat shoes, and frat boys. The main thoroughfares, Union Street and Chestnut Street, offer many boutiques and restaurants. The Marina is also as well kept as the stereotype of its inhabitants suggests, and it can be nice to always find a cab, nail salon, or whatever the trendiest health thing is at the moment.

                        <h6> What to bring and wear </h6>
                        <o>  A picnic is a nice addition to this artsy day. Pack up some food and drink and enjoy a day in the park with the kids. Because you’ll be going inside and out, you’ll want to bring layers to be prepared for all weather conditions. Snacks and a camera are also recommended.</p>
